## Coding Style

This project uses [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com) as a style guide/linter.

Please ensure your code complies with this, before making a PR. The website has a [good list of editor plugins](https://github.com/standard/standard#are-there-text-editor-plugins) to help with this!

Having a style guide keeps things consistent across the project, and makes the code more readable.
